**Exceptions and Recursion**

**Exceptions**
- General purpose technique for error-handling
- Exceptions are thrown
- Immediately stops the function, passes the exception object out of the function, up to the calling function
- A bit like a ``return``
- When you throw an exception, there's always a possibility that it might stop the program

**Other ways to handle errors**
- Global variable flags
- Extra error return value
